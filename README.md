## About

The goal of this project is to recreate an old RTS game [Dark Reign: The Future of War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Reign:_The_Future_of_War) by using HTML5 technologies.

## How to run the game

1. Download files from GitHub
2. Download [media files](http://qmegas.info/dark-reign-html5/media.rar) and extract them to same folder.
3. Upload all files to your site or create virtual domain (it required due to CORS limitations)
4. Open `menu.html` in Chrome or Firefox browsers. IE9/10 still not supported.

OR [See it live](http://qmegas.info/dark-reign-html5/)
