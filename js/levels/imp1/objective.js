	name: '2JUNGLE TEST LEVEL',
	info: 'In the early stages of the conflict, the Freedom Guard was limited to minor acts of sabotage against the Imperium. A young Freedom Guard officer, Jeb Radec, plotted a bold frontal raid on a sizable Imperium supply depot of pure water on the planet Alcine. The plan was considered a suicide mission by the fledgling Freedom Guard ruling Synod, but Radec ignored the Synod and led the assault with a small team of volunteers.',
	objective: 'Attack the Imperium\'s pure water depot and eliminate the defenders. A counter-attack will surely come, but we need you to hold the facility long enough to collect a sufficient supply of water.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n--> Build a Training Facility and Assembly Plant\n--> Destroy all Imperium units defending the water processing facilities\n--> Save 8,000 credits'
