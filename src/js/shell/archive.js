			text: 'THE DECLINE OF EARTH\n\n\nIn the opening centuries of the third millennium, Earth\'s population continued\nto swell at a staggering rate. By 2250 the planet held over 30 billion people.\nEarth\'s scientists raced to offset the strangling effects of population.\nMassive hydroponic agricultural domes dotted the landscape, increasing food\nproduction exponentially. Methods for large scale, economical water\ndesalinization were developed. High altitude aircraft hovered at the crown of\nthe atmosphere, releasing chemicals that slowly built up eroded areas of the\nozone layer. In spite of these advances, the frenetic growth of humanity\ncontinued to strain Earth\'s resources to their limit. Pollution became\nunmanageable. Thousands of pounds of nuclear waste were set adrift in\nspace every year. Air pollution was so severe in many major cities that in\n2267 the European Environmental Council estimated that one of every nine\nurban dwellers died by the age of 30 from lung related diseases.\n\nMillions began living in massive urban complexes which contained air filtering\nand water purification facilities. These structures, as large as ten miles\nsquare, contained housing, commerce and entertainment for their occupants,\nand many people remained inside for years at a time. Wealth had become\nextremely polarized, and life was increasingly arduous for the majority of the\npopulace who could not afford the safe confines of the complexes. Criminals\nbanded together like small armies and in some areas had more control over\nthe streets than the police. \n\nIn 2314 most of the Earth\'s major nations allied to quell the rising tide of\ncrime within their borders. The Global Commonwealth established a\nrudimentary dome colony on Jupiter\'s moon Io and began shipping violent\ncriminals there. Heavily armed Commonwealth forces seized criminals in the\nstreets and poured them into processing facilities. After quick assembly line\ntrials, those deemed "dangerous and irredeemable" were shipped to the penal\ncolony on Io to live out the remainder of their lives. The experiment was\nextremely successful politically. An international regulatory body, the Jovian\nDetention Administration, was established and granted primary claim to all\nprisoners. The JDA also had an autonomous police force that by 2362 was the\nlargest standing army in the world. By 2400 almost a million people were\nexpelled to Io annually. Additional colonies were added on Callisto and\nGanymede, as well as on Neptune\'s moon Triton. Although some felt that the\nenterprise had little to do with meting out justice and was simply an escape\nvalve for population runoff, the program was very popular, and the JDA had\ncome to hold more political and military sway than any single world\ngovernment. \n\nIn 2447 a rocket containing nuclear waste for deep space disposal\nmalfunctioned and crashed near Bombay, killing over four million people in the\nfirst few months. Food stores were contaminated across the continent.\nResulting worldwide famines led to widespread rioting and organized assaults\nagainst fortified urban complexes where food supplies were not seriously\naffected. The JDA, which by this time was the de facto global government,\nstepped in to suppress the uprisings, but it was becoming clear to world\nleaders that the future of Earth was bleak. Interplanetary colonization,\nhowever, was a dangerous and arduous affair. A large private campaign to\npromote colonization by the Ramsdell Corporation in the early twenty-third\ncentury had resulted in thousands of deaths and only a few scattered\nramshackle societies. The prisoner colonies, while self-supporting, were\nbarren, desolate outposts. Few private citizens were willing to confront the\nhazards of colonization.\n\nThe acting president of the JDA, Edward Dalen, negotiated a deal with the\nresidents of the four penal colonies. In exchange for exploring and colonizing\nnew worlds for Earth\'s inhabitants, the prisoners would be granted their\nfreedom. The prisoners were expendable and experienced at living off-world.\nAlthough counting on the off-world prisoners was less than popular, the\ncitizens of Earth were willing to attempt somewhat desperate measures.\nDalen realized that control of Earth\'s sole implement of colonization, in\naddition to the political and military influence he already wielded, would place\nthe JDA in a position of near absolute sovereignty. Dalen also had no\nintention of ever releasing the prisoners. He knew they would never be\naccepted into the societies on the Earth-based colonies, and they were too\nindependent and well organized to be given their own planet. They had shown\nsurprising resourcefulness on the prison colonies. Rather than slipping into\nviolence and chaos as expected, the prisoners had developed efficient,\nproductive communities with the limited means provided them. Dalen knew\nthis would make them able pioneers, but he also realized they would\nrepresent a threat to the JDA if ever given their autonomy.'

			text: 'THE PIONEER AGE\n\n\nScientists quickly located a number of promising host planets in Earth\'s sector\nof the galaxy. The Exploratory Corps, as the prisoner colonists were called,\nset out in massive cargo vessels, each the size of a large city, loaded with\nprovisions, robotic terra-forming machinery, and enough genetic material to\nrecreate self-sustaining ecosystems. Dalen provided the prisoners with only\nenough water for a few years so that if they could not prepare their planet for\nhabitation within that time they would perish. Although some worlds proved\nunable to support life, and thousands of the Exploratory Corps died, a handful\nof worlds were soon ready and the first Earth settlers began to inhabit their\nnew homes. The Corps, when finished with one planet, were picked up and\ntransported to the next. The JDA moved into each new world and established\nthemselves as the governing body and policing force. They assumed control\nof each planet\'s water supply and instituted water rationing. Some planets\ndid not have large enough viable water sources to support their populations,\nso those worlds with excess water were required to give up their surplus. In\nfact, there was more than enough water, but the JDA\'s control of water\ndistribution gave them unchallenged leverage over the individual governments\nestablished on each planet. The JDA began stockpiling the excess water in\nhuge, asteroid-sized storage tanks orbiting a number of undeveloped worlds.\n\nThe Exploratory Corps pushed deeper into the galaxy, with mankind trailing\nbehind, seeping into every crack the Corps opened. Hungry from centuries of\nlimited space and resources, the human race devoured the galaxy. Within a\ngeneration a hundred planets were inhabited. Within two generations, a\nthousand. The JDA declared itself the official galactic government and was\nrenamed the Imperium. Although some worlds chafed at the Imperium\'s\ncontinued dominion over all water supplies, none defied them.'

The dissidents then took refuge on a\nnearby planet, Teron, whose populace had grown tired of the Imperium\'s ever\nincreasing demands on their water supply. An Imperium fleet was quickly\ndispatched to the planet and determined the city in which the stolen ship had\nlanded. Three regiments of Imperium infantry descended to the planet and\nseized the city. The ship was located, and the Corps members guarding the\nship were tortured until they revealed the location of the rest of their unit.\nThe remaining Corps personnel were tracked down and all were killed in an\nopen courtyard. The Imperium left the city intact, but a sizable force of\nImperium troops remained on Teron, and the planet\'s water ration was halved.\n\nThe Imperium\'s ruling Directorate feared that similar incidents would continue\nto occur, and determined to institute a more decisive means of controlling the\nExploratory Corps. Imperium geneticists had been developing enzyme keys\nwhich, when injected into the bloodstream, could crack and alter the DNA code\nof every cell in the body in a prescribed manner. Exploratory Corps personnel\nhad been receiving periodic injections of these substances to improve their\nimmunity to alien bacteria and other microscopic life forms encountered while\ncolonizing new worlds. In response to the Teron incident, a new, more\nambitious strain of genetic keys was developed which created a chemical\nclock in the brain stem that caused life functions to cease at the age of 25.\nThese agents were systematically introduced into all Exploratory Corps\nmembers along with the standard immunity treatments. In addition, the\nchanges in the genetic code made the left eye of each member of the\nExploratory Corps completely black. In this way, the Imperium could easily\nidentify Exploratory Corps members and make it nearly impossible for them to\nescape. In addition, the fact that they would only live to the age of 25 made\nit difficult to organize any sustained effort at rebellion.\n\nThe scheme was more successful than anticipated. Within a few decades, the\nExploratory Corps came to be known as the Marked and began to think of\nthemselves as cursed. There were no further outbreaks of violence, and the\nMarked largely gave up hope of ever being granted their freedom. As the\nbusiness of colonizing the galaxy became less risky and less vital, the\nMarked, who were now viewed as a separate caste from the rest of human\nsociety, were used to perform many of the menial tasks needed by humanity.\nIn time, many among the Marked did not even believe they deserved to be\nfree.'

			text: 'THE DAWN OF WAR\n\n\nIn the late twenty-sixth century, an extraordinary boy, Perigil Ilacas, was born\nto Marked parents. Living in the household of a noted educator, Lajos Cardat,\nfor whom his parents worked as servants, young Ilacas spoke seven\nlanguages by the age of five and was versed in a number of sciences. As the\nparents approached 25, they made a deal with Cardat, who was sympathetic to\nthe plight of the Marked, to raise the boy as his own. Only in this way could\nIlacas continue his education. To pass the boy off as a citizen, his mark\nwould somehow have to be removed, but the marks had been engineered to\nbe resistant to removal, even by techniques such as tissue replacement. Once\nthe new tissue was accepted by the body, the enzyme keys, which remained\nin the bloodstream of every marked human, would simply alter the new cells,\nand the mark would reappear. Cardat arranged for the boy\'s eye to be\nremoved and replaced with a cybernetic replica, a procedure that was\nextremely expensive and, if discovered, would have resulted in death for all\ninvolved. By the age of 19, Ilacas had become a leading scholar in the field of\ngenetics. Although he never told his adoptive father, the real motivation\nbehind his study was to uncover the genetic basis for the mark. \n\nIlacas eventually found the enzyme keys that were responsible for the\ndifferences in the DNA and deduced that these were man-made agents that\nhad at some point been deliberately introduced into the Marked population.\nHowever, now age 22, Ilacas feared that he would not be able to discover how\nto counteract the keys in the few years he had left and feared also that if his\nresearch was ever uncovered by the Imperium, it would be destroyed. He\ndecided to make his discovery public in the hope that other scientists would\njoin his endeavor or even that public knowledge of the fact that the mark was\na manufactured product of the Imperium would force them to release his\npeople from their genetic bondage.\n\nWithin a week of the announcement, Ilacas, Cardat, and all those associated\nwith his research were dead. However, news of the incident spread, and\nquickly small uprisings flared up around the galaxy. The Marked found\nsupport on numerous planets. Some viewed the Marked as mankind\'s\npioneers who had delivered humanity from their doomed homeland of Earth.\nSome believed their subservience was unnecessary. Some simply saw an\nopportunity to throw off the yoke of the Imperium and reap the profits of their\nown bounty. Imperium warships were hijacked, complexes sabotaged, water\nconvoys seized. Several planets, including Teron, raged into full revolt. The\nrebellion slowly grew more organized, and within a decade the Marked had\nbecome a dedicated revolutionary army. Calling themselves the Freedom\nGuard, they coordinated the efforts of a hundred insurgent worlds into a\nunified endeavor. Although outnumbered, technologically inferior, and lacking\nstrategic strongholds, the vastness of the Imperium\'s domain worked to the\nrebels\' advantage. The Freedom Guard struck at strategic targets and then\nmoved on, never facing the formidable Imperium war machine head on. After\nyears of trying to smother the growing tide of insurrection, the Imperium\nfound itself facing full-fledged civil war.'

			text: 'THE DESICCATOR\n\n\nIn 2618 Imperium general Gregor Trilkin approached the Imperium\'s Ruling\nDirectorate and requested permission to develop a new weapon. Tired of\npursuing smaller Freedom Guard forces across the breadth of the galaxy only\nto engage them in inconsequential skirmishes, he wanted a potent new tool to\nturn the course of the war. Trilkin\'s arms research scientists had actually\nalready designed a devastating new chemical weapon, a catalyzing compound\nthat sheared the hydrogen atoms from water molecules. The compound then\nincorporated the free hydrogen atoms, thereby reproducing itself and\ncontinuing to divide any water molecules it came in contact with. The effect\ncould be transferred through airborne water molecules and even through water\nin living organisms. One molecule of the compound could therefore consume\nall the moisture in an entire planet in a matter of minutes. The Ruling\nDirectorate was hesitant to develop a weapon whose function was to destroy\nthe very implement of their control, but Trilkin assured them that they would\nonly need use the Desiccator once. Once its force was demonstrated, Trilkin\nclaimed, the Freedom Guard would relent. Trilkin ultimately planned to use\nthe weapon to seize control of the Imperium. With sole command of the\nDesiccator, the Ruling Directorate would have no choice but to submit to his\nauthority. The Directorate Chairman, Albrach Boas, was aware of Trilkin\'s new\nweapon from several of his personal moles in Trilkin\'s command. He also\nsuspected the general\'s intentions for the Desiccator, but needed someone to\nput an end to the war and knew Trilkin was the best man for the job. Trilkin\nwas a ruthless and efficient tactician, but a predictable politician, and Boas\nfelt he could deal with Trilkin after he had put down the Freedom Guard.'

			text: 'THE TOGRANS\n\n\nThe Togran Foundation was founded in 2382 by molecular physicist Alpheus\nTogra, son of Petrak Togra, the third and last Chancellor of the Global\nCommonwealth. Petrak\'s assassination in 2356 led to the Rubicon rebellions\nand ultimately to the demise of the Commonwealth. JDA president Grote\nReber suppressed the rebellions in four short days without consulting any of\nthe national governments involved. The JDA\'s position of global leadership\nwas cemented. Reber negotiated the dissolution of the Global Commonwealth\nand the transfer of its remaining authority, mostly bureaucratic, to the JDA.\n\nAlpheus, only nine at the time of his father\'s death, studied under his mother,\nphysicist Gisela Togra, who won the Nobel Prize for physics in 2349 for her\nneutrino reactor. By his early twenties Togra had surpassed his mother in\nreputation. His Foundation, which he established at the age of 35, was\ndedicated to the development of a new paradigm of human understanding of\nthe physical universe. Togra rejected the five hundred year old reductionist\napproach to science. Togra believed that matter could be easily and\npermanently altered at the molecular level and steadfastly maintained that\nthe necessary knowledge and tools to allow such conversion could be\nuncovered in his lifetime. Matter, he claimed, like all of reality, is more than a\nsum of its parts. His research focused on element 115, discovered in the outer\nplanets in the early days of exploration of the solar system. Element 115 was\nthe only stable member of the very heavy elements. Other elements over\natomic weight of 92 undergo spontaneous fission almost immediately. In\naddition, the "strong" force in element 115, the force that binds the nucleus\ntogether, was unusually powerful and similar enough to gravity that the force\ncould be tapped and amplified and used to make a gravity drive for\ninterstellar travel. The drive bent space in the same way that gravity does\nand actually pulled the destination point to the traveler. While the peculiar\nproperties of element 115 were accepted by most scientists, none had been\nable to unravel its mysteries. Togra claimed that the element represented\nproof that our understanding of the nature of the physical world was flawed,\nand claimed that by unlocking the secret of element 115, he could transform\nEarth, even the entire galaxy, into a paradise. Although considered one of the\ngreat thinkers of his age, Togra\'s obsession with element 115 was mocked as\nyet another megalomaniacal attempt to turn lead into gold. Togra countered,\n"If I can tame the soul of matter, what need would I have for gold?"\n\nA man of considerable charisma and rare genius, Togra developed a dedicated\nfollowing and became a spiritual as well as scientific leader. Togra claimed\nthat the great scientists were simply discovering what the great mystics had\nalways known in a less literal way. He believed that inquiry into the\nmetaphysical realm was as important to mankind\'s development as scientific\nadvancement. Many of the world\'s leading minds abandoned their own work\nto join the Togran Foundation. By 2387, Foundation members numbered nearly\none thousand, and Togra\'s work on matter conversion was making great\nstrides. Togra became increasingly withdrawn and secretive about the\nFoundation\'s research. He suspected that several Foundation members were\nleaking information to the JDA. Togra stopped accepting new members and\nexpelled three Foundationers he believed were selling his secrets. He began\nworking entirely alone, often fasting and meditating for days at a time. He\nwas rarely seen in public and grew increasingly paranoid.\n\nIn 2391, Togra confided to a few of his closest associates that he had cracked\nelement 115\'s secret. Before Einstein it was believed that energy and mass, as\nwell as linear and angular momentum, were each independently conserved;\nthat is, none could be created or destroyed. Einstein showed that energy and\nmass were in fact interchangeable and united them under a single\nconservation law. Through his work with element 115, Togra found that linear\nand angular momentum were also equivalent to mass and energy, as well as\ncharge, quark number, and several other variables. All of these, he claimed,\nare aspects of a single essence that obeys a single conservation law. The\nunusual nuclear forces of element 115 were due to the fact that the momentum\nof the electrons of its atoms was being converted to the "strong" force in the\nnucleus and back at an incredibly fast rate. Based on this discovery Togra\nwas able, in a small scale reactor, to convert the angular momentum in the\nelectrons of an atom of hydrogen into mass. He estimated that a single atom\nof hydrogen could produce as much matter as a fair-sized asteroid. He\nneeded only to refine the process to make the reaction produce the desired\nelement, and build a number of large-scale reactors to allow near unlimited\nmatter conversion. He was certain, however, that the JDA was about to seize\nhis research, and he decided to abandon his home planet and move the\nFoundation to an off-world colony. Togra claimed to have found a host planet\nnear the galactic center on which a habitable ecosystem could be developed\nwithin a few years. Within a generation, he claimed, they could build their own\nheaven. Four hundred thirty-seven Foundation members, some of the world\'s\nforemost biologists, chemists, physicists, mathematicians, doctors, and\nphilosophers agreed to accompany Togra. Within a few months Togra\norganized a small expeditionary force of cargo vessels with light warship\nsupport. Togra had expected the JDA to resist the endeavor, but they seemed\nto view the departure of the Foundation as simply an opportunity to be rid of\nsome of their most influential, outspoken agitators. However, as the Togran\nexpedition reached the outskirts of the solar system, Togra\'s paranoia proved\nvalid. An attack force of JDA ships ambushed the convoy, engaging the\nwarship escort while cutting off Togra\'s ship and attempting to board it.\nUnknown to even the other members of the expedition, Togra was armed and\nprepared for the attack. He killed two JDA agents and placed a small\nexplosive device on the boarding vessel. His ship was damaged in the\nexplosion, but he managed to escape the skirmish, leaving the remaining\nTograns behind. When the remaining JDA ships realized what had happened,\nthey disengaged and attempted to follow Togra, but no trace of him was\nfound. The Togran vessels, without their leader but unable to return to Earth\nfor fear of the JDA, decided to continue on to their destination and hope that\nTogra would somehow find his way there. A few days later the Tograns\nreceived a garbled transmission from Togra. His ship was damaged beyond\nrepair. His navigation systems were not functioning, and he had barely\nmanaged to ditch the ship on an unknown planet. \n\nBy the time of the Freedom Wars the Tograns were merely a curious anecdote\nin the Imperium\'s Neuro-Historical Archives. However, the Tograns had\nflourished on their new home planet. By genetically engineering offspring,\nthey developed a society of more than one hundred thousand within a few\ngenerations. Most of the subsistence work was done by machines, and the\nneed for government was minimal. To avoid pollution, the Togran industrial\ncomplex was maintained in massive factory vessels that orbited the planet.\nTogran society grew increasingly insular and monastic. The majority of the\nsociety\'s resources was dedicated to scientific research, and citizens did little\nbut work, study, and pray. With disease all but conquered, the Foundation\nmembers survived for hundreds of years, pursuing the limits of human\nknowledge with a dedication approaching madness. However, although Togran\ntechnology far surpassed that of the Imperium worlds, the Foundation\nscientists had been unable to reproduce Togra\'s breakthrough in matter\nconversion. \n\nFor generations the Tograns scoured the galaxy for their lost leader but found\nno trace of him. Togra eventually rose to a mythical status in Togran society,\nand his followers stopped searching for him. They believed that their lost\nprophet would return to deliver them without need of their intervention, but as\nthe centuries rolled by, Togra did not appear.\n\nThe war between the Imperium and the Freedom Guard raged across the\ngalaxy, destroying everything in its wake. Eventually the war spread to the\nremote Togran home worlds. Although superior technologically, the Tograns\nhad no experience with warfare and their society was crushed in the\nonslaught.'

			text: 'Jeb Radec\n\nJebediah Radec was born in 2588 to Marked parents in the Remus cluster. At\nthe age of twelve he was assigned to new colonization duty after paralyzing a\nteenage boy in a street fight. The Pioneer Age was over, and planetary\nexploration was of marginal importance to the Imperium. Colonization\nremained a hazardous endeavor and was used primarily as punishment for\nmembers of the Marked class who resisted the regime, but whose crimes did\nnot warrant execution. Radec was among the youngest to ever be assigned\ncolonization duty.\n\nAt 16, Radec escaped by sabotaging a nuclear waste facility on a colony near\nthe Algo Rim and stowing away in an Imperium cruiser in the confusion that\nfollowed. Hundreds were killed in the fallout from the explosion of the waste\ndump, mostly members of the Marked crew that Radec worked with. Years\nlater, when Radec was questioned about the incident as a Freedom Guard\ncommander, he said, "I won\'t fight for the freedom of any man who doesn\'t\nhave the dignity to fight for it himself."\n\nThe Imperium hunted Radec unsuccessfully for several years. When the\nFreedom Guard revolution began, Radec was smuggling black market goods on\nTeron, the heart of the rebellion. He lead a mob of rioters who seized the\ncapitol city of Borrud and captured and executed hundreds of Imperium\nsoldiers. Shortly thereafter, a volunteer army was organized on Teron, and\nRadec was asked by Gerhad Bantrill to serve as a field commander for the\nregion. Bantrill, the newly appointed Freedom Guard Synod councilor on Teron,\nwas a respected statesman and former Imperium officer who had joined the\ncause of the revolutionaries. Radec accepted, confiding to Bantrill that his\nmotivation was not justice but vengeance. His success as a military leader\nwas remarkable. In spite of the urgings of his superiors, Radec always fought\non the front lines with his men. He rarely lost a conflict, and as his military\nvictories convinced the masses that the Imperium dominion could be\nchallenged, the ranks of the Freedom Guard swelled. Within a year the Synod\nhad placed him in command of  the entire standing army. Within three years,\nhe had taken control of the Synod.\n\nThroughout his career as a commander, Radec was known for his refusal to\ntake prisoners. Radec\'s troops fought with barbarous ferocity, and some\nbelieved this was because his soldiers were more afraid of him than they\nwere the enemy.  Radec once offered to relinquish his command to any man\nthat could best him in a fair fight, and he was taken up on the challenge\nseveral times until he threw one of his officers out the window of a forty\nstory Command Center on Perlen.\n\n Radec lived well past the age of twenty five. Although members of the\n Marked did occasionally live past their twenty fifth year, it was extremely rare\n and generally provided only a few extra months of life. Radec\'s longevity\n caused many to believe that the commander was super-human. Others\n thought that the force of his will simply would not allow him to die until he\n had seen the Imperium defeated.'

This would require a much more advanced type of\nenzyme than that used to produce the Mark. Geneticists had long been able\nto introduce  catalysts that would alter an organism at the genetic level, and\ntherefore carry the modification into the organism\'s offspring. However, a\nchange like the Mark, which made the carrier die at age 25, was a basic\naddition to the genetic code. Altering an intangible entity like personality or\nintellect was a far trickier undertaking.\n\nMany scientists believed that thoughts and actions could not be directly\nmapped to physiological occurrences. Karoch, however, had meticulously\nrecorded long term neural firing patterns within individuals, and demonstrated\nthat for any person a model could be extrapolated from the data that would\npredict behavior within reasonable statistical parameters. Karoch further\ndiscovered that the behavior models of family members were surprisingly\nsimilar. Clearly, personality was at least partially inherited.  For almost a\ndecade, Karoch attempted, with enormous Imperium funding, to determine the\nexact genetic underpinnings of human character.\n\nAs Karoch approached what he was looking for, he learned of the Ruling\nDirectorate\'s plans for his work. He uncovered several experiments where\ngenetic keys had been developed based on his findings and introduced into\nImperium soldiers to make them less concerned for their own safety. Karoch\nwas appalled when he realized the magnitude of what could be done with his\nresearch. He secretly sabotaged his work and attempted to leak a cure for\nthe Mark, which was also being developed under his direction, to the Freedom\nGuard.'

Gregor\'s mother passed\naway when he was an infant, and by the time Trilkin was in his early teens,\nall of his brothers had died of radiation related illnesses. At seventeen,\nTrilkin left his father, who was institutionalized and almost completely senile,\nand joined the Imperium Galactic Fleet. During his basic training, Trilkin\ngained favor with his superiors by reporting several soldiers who were\ndistributing contraband material to the cadets. Several days later, Trilkin was\nsavagely beaten by the same soldiers, who were subsequently court-martialed\nand imprisoned.\n\nTrilkin demonstrated an immediate talent for military tactics and was offered\na position as an instructor at the military academy on Shenton. He refused,\nrequesting active duty, and was placed in command of a small company of\nInterceptor class light warships patrolling for smugglers near the Turndorf\nNebula. Within a year, almost all smuggling in the region had been eliminated.\nImperium law allowed for immediate execution of any individual caught trading\nillegal goods, but the provision was almost never exercised. Some regions\nsurvived on black market trade, and most policing officials simply ignored the\npractice. Trilkin, however, did not. He captured dozens of smugglers and\nexecuted them all.\n\nBy the time the Freedom Guard revolution began, Trilkin had reached the rank\nof colonel. While many Imperium officers wished to avoid combat duty, Trilkin\nimmediately requested front line duty. In the early years of the conflict, the\nFreedom Guard was poorly equipped and unorganized, and Trilkin dealt them\ncrushing defeats whenever he was able to engage their forces squarely. What\nTrilkin lacked in tactical subtlety, he made up for with unflagging tenacity and\nmerciless brutality.\n\nTrilkin was quickly promoted to general and shortly thereafter was the driving\nforce behind The Purge. As the Freedom Guard began to enjoy its first\nmilitary victories, pressure was high within Imperium ranks to find scapegoats.\nTrilkin accused several of his fellow commanders of being Freedom Guard\nsympathizers. Although there was no evidence to support his indictment, the\nmen were discharged, and the phenomenon quickly spread. Eventually\nhundreds of high ranking Imperium officials and military commanders were\naccused of treason. Most of the accused were relieved of office, and a\nnumber were even executed. At age 32, after less than 15 years in the\nmilitary, Trilkin was placed in charge of the entire Imperium armed forces.\nOne of Trilkin\'s first acts in his new position was to commission the creation\nof a super weapon to put a final end to the Freedom Guard. A little over a\nyear later, Imperium scientists developed the Dessicator.'

He then studied political\nand military history at the great University of Utrecht where he graduated with\nhonors. Bantrill\'s family pushed him to move into politics, but he took a\nposition as a professor at a university on Teron instead.

When the revolution began, Bantrill\nwas still living on Teron, and he established the Freedom Guard resistance\nthere.

Indeed, it soon became clear to the\nImperium directorate that for the Freedom Guard to produce material and\nsoldiers at the rate they were demonstrating, they must be enjoying\nsubstantial outside help. And it was no secret that any of a number of large\ncolonial manufacturing and shipping operations might well see the potential of\nthe Imperium\'s loss of direct control over their day to day affairs as a\npositive development. It was in fact the case that one such large shipping\nconcern did decide to secretly aid the Freedom Guard. They recognized that\nthe principal thing the Freedom Guard lacked, other than equipment, was\nexperienced fighters - and they knew just where to find them.\n\nRenowned for his feats of strength and cunning, the fiery Jon Bard had\nbecome a legend throughout much of the galaxy. Bard had been trained in the\nImperium military and was in fact a young officer on a transport ship when he\nmade the most fateful decision of his life. When his ship came into port in\nPeyrak, he found that several of the items being unloaded from the hold did\nnot appear on his manifest. Upon investigation, he dicovered several crates\ncontaining neat stacks of  humans who were being shipped, frozen, to some\nnearby mining colonies. There they would drone away in caves in a condition\nof virtual slavery. Horrified by the discovery of this secret cargo, Bard ordered\nthe crates reloaded. He then single-handedly seized control of the ship, killing\nthe captain and physically throwing his crewmates out onto the loading\nplatform. Once away, he "thawed" the captive passengers who instantly\nbecame his first followers.\n\nFor years Bard and his group lived as fugitives and as such were forced to\ntrain themselves to always be prepared for combat. When they were\napproached by Encryton Shipping about joining the Freedom Guard war effort\nas guns for hire, Bard and his band readily assented. It was in fact Jon Bard\nwho introduced the Freedom Guard to the effectiveness of the Rail Gun, and it\nwas this type of weapon that Bard\'s Mercenaries used to deadly effect for the\nremainder of the conflict.'

(It can\nbe fairly assumed that much of the research that went into the development\nof Bions took place at the Arcundrel Center.) \n\nIt was the Shadowhand that initially suggested to the directorate that some of\nthe Center\'s research into biotoxins might be put to good use on the\nbattlefield. Soldiers who were badly wounded could be shot full of a kind of\nadrenal booster, giving them a burst of fighting energy. The boosters were\ntoxic, and ultimately fatal, but the idea was appealing to the military because\nit meant that engaged troops could stay in the field longer. For the delivery\nof the required biodarts, the Shadowhand  recommended using some of the\ncybergenetic creations that worked in Arcundrel. Accepting the Shadowhand\'s\nsuggestions, the Imperium High Command soon put into action several teams\nof these tri-legged, half-human monsters. In time they found that the\n"Ampers", as they came to be called, could even be used effectively against\nhealthy Freedom Guard infantry. Upon seeing these creatures in battle,\nFreedom Guard leader Gerhad Bantrill observed, "If any are still in doubt as to\nthe justice and urgency of our cause, they need only see this horror and the\ninfected character of our enemy will be made undeniably plain."'

As legend has it, many years ago,\nunruly prisoners interred at the old Jovian Detention Facility were shipped off\nto work in the quarries on Callisto. Those who were captured trying to escape\nwere said to have been slowly dismembered in front of the other prisoners\nwith the huge circular saws used to cut out large sections of the rock. (While\nthis may have never really happened, the stories were well known to\ngenerations of misbehaving children descended from the ranks of the old\nExploratory Corps.) Imperium General Feileen Hextar decided it would be clever\nto revive these rumors as a prelude to the introduction of the frightening new\nanti-infantry weapon that the old story had inspired. Many of the earlier\nmodels of  Hextar\'s new "Shredders" were in fact manufactured using re-tooled\ncircular quarrysaw blades. These fiendish unmanned disks of death cut down\nscores of Freedom Guard Raiders in their first action on Teron.'

Their desire to continue in this\nrelationship stemmed in part from their frustration in trying to find a way to\nrespond to the suicide attacks of Freedom Guard Martyrs. Representatives of\nthe Shadowhand had promised the High Command they had a way to serve the\nFreedom Guard a taste of their own poison. Few details were offered. When\nImperium generals expressed their reservations, the Shadowhand responded\nby arriving uninvited on the battlefield with a whole platoon of these evil,\nbody-sucking monsters. "Demonstrations" were first made of a small group of\nFreedom Guard prisoners being guarded nearby. Almost in an instant, each\nman was sucked into the dark maw of the hump-backed beast. The officer in\ncharge was incensed. "We were going to question those people!" he protested.\n"Questioning?" responded the unnamed Shadowhand operative. "It is fortunate\nfor the Directorate that our methods are not so primitive. If you want to know\nwhat they knew...ah, yes. It\'s coming across just now." He handed his personal\nconsole to the dumbfounded Imperium commander. "And now, observe." He\ngestured toward the rear of the vehicle, where one by one the men who had\nso recently been sucked in suddenly emerged. Each had a kind of pack\nstrapped to his back. They did not speak and barely even twitched as they\nstared blankly outward. "And now," intoned the operative softly as he gently\nstruck a key on his console. Suddenly the prisoners\' eyed shot fully open and\neach man spun on his heel and began running full speed out of the encapment\nand back in the direction of the Freedom Guard\'s base. Moments later, loud\nconcussions could be heard from the same direction. The officer in charge\nsmiled at the operative, and the partnership was born.'
